# GLSLsmith tracking of potential compiler bugs

A collection of shaders inducing different behaviours accross compilers.
The shaders have been discovered as part of the GLSLsmith project. Each shader is encapsulated in a shadertrap format to be executed as an independent test.

# GLSLsmith presentation

GLSLsmith is a random shader generator, developed on the [GraphicsFuzz](https://github.com/google/graphicsfuzz) framework.
The source code for glslsmith can be found on the fork of the project: [AaronGhost/GraphicsFuzz](https://github.com/google/graphicsfuzz).

# Stressed compilers

Programs generated by GLSLsmith have been tested across multiple compilers:
* NVIDIA OpenGL driver (_NVIDIA linux driver 460_)
* LLVMPipe (_Mesa 21.1.2_)
* Angle/Swiftshader (_Subzero angle build_ https://github.com/google/angle/commit/a5c3785ed8d6a35868bc169f07e40e889087fd2e)

# Shadertrap test usage

1. Get or build Shadertrap: 
    1. A build version of Shadertrap for linux can be found on [Shadertrap release repository](https://github.com/google/gfbuild-shadertrap/releases). 
    2. To build from source, please refer to [Shadertrap repository](https://github.com/google/shadertrap)
2. Execute the Shadertrap command
```shell
bin/shadertrap shader0x.shadertrap
```
3. Collect the buffer results in the execution folder (one file per buffer)
